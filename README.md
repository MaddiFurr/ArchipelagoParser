# ArchipelagoParser
 
Welcome. I hate this

To use this program, simply run the python file and put the path to your file you want to parse. 'python parse.py <path to file to parse>'

Follow the instructions... ESPECIALLY in regards to pruning out data from the file. The Archipelago devs love having zero consistency and I couldn't be bothered to write code to ignore it.

It should work beyond that. If not, reach out, but I can't promise I'll help you fix anything. Hence why its open source dummy.
