# ArchipelagoParser
 
Welcome. I hate this

This little script is was written to parse through the spoiler file that gets generated with each Archipelago run. It will help you figure out the order in which everyone will finish.

To use this program, simply run the python file and put the path to your file you want to parse. 'python parse.py <path to file to parse>'

Follow the instructions... ESPECIALLY in regards to pruning out data from the file. The Archipelago devs love having zero consistency and I couldn't be bothered to write code to ignore it.

It should work beyond that. If not, reach out, but I can't promise I'll help you fix anything. Hence why its open source dummy.
